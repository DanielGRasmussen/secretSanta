# Overview

I wrote a terminal based Secret Santa picker. You can give it information like family member's names and it will save them in a file that you can later have it randomly pick from. It will ask if close family members and the previous selection should be possibly picked.

I wrote this to learn the Kotlin language and figure out more things I can do to expand my skills.

# Development Environment

I used Intellij IDEA with Kotlin and the java.io.FileWriter library.

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

# Future Work

* I need to remove the Utils.toMap function and replace it with how you are supposed to do it.
* I should swap the .txt file out for something like a json file with gson.
